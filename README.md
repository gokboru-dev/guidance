Colorful Vehicle Control
------------------------

Control a vehicle with the power of colors!

Description:
------------
This Python project allows you to control a vehicle based on the color detected in a video stream. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the program identifies a specific color in real-time and translates its position into commands for the vehicle.

Features:
---------
- Real-time color detection in a video stream
- Simple and intuitive control mechanism
- Support for various colors, including black, white, red, green, and blue
- Easy integration with any compatible vehicle

Requirements:
-------------
To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- A compatible vehicle with pymavlink library

Installation:
--------------
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/colorful-vehicle-control.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd colorful-vehicle-control

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
-------
1. Connect your compatible vehicle to your computer.

2. Run the color_control.py script:

   python color_control.py

3. Place a colored object in front of the camera and watch as the vehicle responds to its position.

4. Experiment with different colors and have fun controlling the vehicle!

Example:
---------
color_control.py

import cv2
from color_detection import detect_color

# Set up video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the video stream
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Detect the color and get its position
    color = detect_color(frame)

    # Control the vehicle based on the color position
    # ...

    # Display the video stream with color information
    cv2.imshow("Colorful Vehicle Control", frame)

    # Exit loop on 'q' key press
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release video capture and close windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
